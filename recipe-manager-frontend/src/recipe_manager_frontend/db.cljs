If your kitchen is quite warm you can refrigerate the yudane to help control the final dough temperature. You can also make it a day ahead of time and keep it in the fridge until you need it."}
      {:step/instructions "Make the dough. In a large bowl combine all the ingredients except the remaining flour. Mix well. Add the flour and mix to a dough."}
      {:step/instructions "Tip the dough out on the table and knead it for 6 minutes. It will be extremely sticky, so stop every now and then and scrape it together. The stickiness comes from the ingredients used. Egg yolks, sugar, and the oil all make the dough stickier. Combine those with whole wheat flour and you are going to get a stickier than normal dough. If you have a mixer â€“ use it! *Desired dough temperature 25C (77F). If your dough is warmer, then it will ferment more rapidly. If it is cooler, then it will take longer. Adjust proofing time accordingly."

     "The flour I use has a protein content of 13%. If your flour is weaker, then you may need to lower the hydration.

  If you are using active dry yeast, then you may need to let it sit in the water for 10 minutes before adding the other ingredients or else it could take a lot longer to raise the dough.
